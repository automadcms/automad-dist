# Automad Language Packs

A collection of language packs for the [Automad](https://automad.org) dashboard.

This package replaces the internal language packs and will be the default collection of translations for the upcoming Automad version 2.

> Note it is not possible to use the included language packs with Automad version 1!

## Contributing

The text modules in this repository are initially translated from English to other languages by an AI.
This process is not always so straight forward and partially wrong translations are expected.
Therefore any help improving those tranlations is more than welcome. Just make a pull-request.

The original English text modules can be found in the official [Automad repository](https://github.com/marcantondahmen/automad)
under `automad/lang/english.json`.

Please also take a look at the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for this repository before starting your work!
Note that only pull-requests that follow the contribution guide will be accepted.
