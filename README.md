## Installation

Automad can be installed using [Docker](https://docker.com), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) or manually.

### Composer

The fastest way to get Automad up and running is to use Composer.

	composer create-project automad/automad .

Follow this [guide](https://automad.org/getting-started#composer) to finish the installation and get started quickly.

### Docker

It is also possible to run Automad in a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/automad/automad) container including **Nginx** and **PHP 8**. 

	docker run -dp 80:80 --name mysite automad/automad

The first time you run the image, a new user account for the Automad dashboard will be created automatically. The account details will be logged by the running container. You can show these logs using the following command:

	docker logs mysite

Your can now navigate to [localhost](http://localhost) to view your new site.

### Manual Download

Alternatively Automad can also be [installed manually](https://automad.org/getting-started#manual-installation).
