## :wave: Version 2

Currently, the development of version 2 is _very, very active_. New features and fixes are implemented on a daily basis.
The version 2 update will essentially be a full rewrite of the entire application, including the _backend_, _frontend_, _standard theme_ and _blocks_.
The goal is to also include as many open feature requests and resolve as many open issues as possible until the day of the release.
Existing themes and extensions will continue to work just fine and will be compatible with version 2.
Minor breaking changes will be communicated with the relase notes.

The new dashboard will be entirely written in _TypeScript_ and will no longer have jQuery and UIkit as dependencies.
The new backend will require at least _PHP 8.2_ or newer.

Please note that this is an open-source project that is free to use and the maintainer spends a substatial portion of his free time, weekends and nights in
order to finish the release as soon as possible. That said, there is no fix release date yet. It is done whenever it is done. In the meantime you can
safely start new website using version 1 and migrate to version 2 afterwards.

**Please also consider the above when opening new issues in order to not waste anybody's time.**

And as always, **pull-request will continue to be ignored** as stated below.

In case you want to help, **please give this repository a star**, consider a small donation or take a look a these other possible ways to [contribute](#contributing) to the project.

## Installation

Automad can be installed using [Docker](https://docker.com), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) or manually.

### Composer

The fastest way to get Automad up and running is to use Composer.

    composer create-project automad/automad .

Follow this [guide](https://automad.org/getting-started#composer) to finish the installation and get started quickly.

### Docker

It is also possible to run Automad in a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/automad/automad) container including **Nginx** and **PHP 8**.

    docker run -dp 80:80 -v ./app:/app --name mysite automad/automad

The first time you run the image, a new user account for the Automad dashboard will be created automatically. The account details will be logged by the running container. You can show these logs using the following command:
